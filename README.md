# sync_my_files
 A file sync client written in python3
## Dependencies
- Python 3.9 (Version that I used to test this, older python versions may be compatible too)
- dirsync library. You can find it's code [here](https://github.com/tkhyn/dirsync/). And you can install this library by **pip install dirsync**

## About
- I wrote this program because I wanted to be able to sync my files from one directory to another.

### I aim to add new features in future:
- Being able to delete files from target directories from client directory. Right now deleted files from client does not remove files from other side
- A graphic interface
- Moving files inside client and mirror the changes to target directory
- Adding Licence to project. (Right now I don't know much about Open Source Licenses so my product is unlicensed.)
